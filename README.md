A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this project, I combined modern technologies and best practices to create a dynamic, user-friendly shopping experience. Here are some key highlights:

🔒 Authentication for secure login and registration.
📸 Camera Integration for capturing profile pictures during registration.
🔄 BLoC and Cubit state management for efficient app flow and responsiveness.
🏬 Home Page Categories including Electronics, Jewellery, Men’s Clothes, and Women’s Clothes for easy navigation.

This project helped me deepen my skills in Flutter, state management, and integrating external libraries.
